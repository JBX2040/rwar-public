# rrolf
## ideas for future forks of rrolf
- a way to prestige to get skill points that can for example double your damage
- sandbox pvp maybe similar to diep

## unofficial rrolf fork discord servers
- to add your own, make an issue with an invite to your server and I will consider adding it

## for developers: 
if you're feeling really inclined to make a pull request for whatever reason then make one for this readme page with build instructions
client: ``cmake .. -DDEBUG_BUILD=0 -DWASM_BUILD=0 && make -j`nproc` ``
server: ``cmake .. -DDEBUG_BUILD=0 && make -j`nproc` ``
